# Vendored test vectors

This file is about `tests/**/_data/`, and about the one test module that
carries its vectors inline, `tests/schemes/dsa_anti_exfil_test.py`.

Upstream prose that this package *paraphrases* has no entry here: a
BIP's reasoning, a Core comment, a C library header's rationale are
cited in the docstring or the comment that paraphrases them, and a
paraphrase admits no byte comparison, so there is nothing for the weekly
job to ask. What such a citation carries is decided by what it names. A
file needs no revision -- the repository and the path keep their names,
and a reader who opens it reads the reasoning upstream holds now, which
is what a paraphrase sends them for -- and `ecc.ecc.dsa`'s
anti-exfil docstrings cite `include/secp256k1_ecdsa_s2c.h` of
BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp that way. A line needs one: a line
number is the one thing that moves under a file that keeps its name, so
without a revision the citation degrades into pointing at whatever now
occupies it.

Where every file under a `tests/**/_data/` directory came from, and
whether our copy still matches it. The test modules already cite their
sources, but against `master`: a citation like
`bips/blob/master/bip-0340/test-vectors.csv` names a file that changes
under us and says nothing about the revision we copied. Here each
citation is pinned to a commit and the two blobs are compared.

Nothing in this file is a mirror of the citations in the test modules.
Those say what a vector *is*; this says which revision of it we hold --
and for the transcribed ones the answer is "no revision of it, byte for
byte", which the verdict then accounts for.

The two halves are kept in agreement in one direction only: a test module
names its upstream and points here for the revision, and this file does
not restate what a vector tests. A citation that names the wrong upstream
is corrected in the module; this file is not where that correction lives.

## Naming

A vendored file carries the name its upstream publishes it under, wherever
upstream publishes a file at all. That is not cosmetic: a name of our own
has no upstream name to be compared against, so the citation in the module
that loads it can drift to a path upstream never had and nobody catches
it -- the byte comparison below is the only check the naming cannot fool.

The files that keep a name of their own do so deliberately, and the reason
is the same in each: there is no upstream file whose name they could take

- `rfc6979.json` is transcribed from prose: no upstream file, so no
  upstream name to take.
- `WYCHEPROOF_COPYING` is upstream's `LICENSE`, renamed because a file
  of that name inside a directory of vendored vectors would read as
  licensing all of them. Its entry says so, and carries the upstream
  name.

## Reading an entry

Where an entry pins to a commit, it gives the upstream repository, the
path in it, and the commit. A `blob` line, where the entry carries one,
gives the git blob SHA-1 of what that entry pins; what it pins, and
whether it was compared byte for byte, is the entry's own to say. An
`ours` line gives the blob of the file kept here where that is not the
`blob`, or where the entry has no upstream blob to name: a file with its
line endings or trailing newline changed, a transcription, a set derived
from a directory. The weekly job holds the file to `ours`, or to `blob`
where there is no `ours`. Most
entries close on a verdict; one with nothing upstream to compare
against says so in prose instead. The verdicts used:

- **identical** -- our file and the upstream blob are the same bytes.
- **reformatted** -- same parsed JSON value, different whitespace.
- **transcribed** -- there is no file compared byte for byte. Over prose
  (a BIP, an RFC) the check is that every value in our copy appears
  verbatim in the pinned text; over a source file the check is the
  entry's own to state.
- **composed locally**, **recorded** -- there is nothing upstream to
  compare, so the entry says what stands in for one. *composed locally*
  is a case written for this suite, naming the third implementation
  that answered it; *recorded* is one reply a program gave, kept
  verbatim, naming the program and the calls that ask it again.

A case of this package's own is written in the test module that reads
the file, never inside the file, so refreshing a pin is a fetch and never
a merge.

`pulled` is the date of the commit that added the file, and `refreshed`
the date of each later commit that changed its bytes. Each is the
committer date of a commit on the default branch, listed by
`git log --follow --raw --format='%h %cd' --date=short origin/main -- <path>`.
A commit whose `--raw` line keeps the blob, a rename, is neither. Where
`--follow` goes on past a copy (`C`) into another file's history, the
copy is the commit that added this one. A file this repository's first
commit carried came over from btclib-org/btclib, whose history this
repository does not carry: its earlier dates are read in that
repository's log, against the file's path under `tests/`. That first
commit is a `refreshed` date only where it changed the bytes.

`behind` counts upstream revisions of that path since the pin. It is a
staleness figure, not a defect: a vector file is a fixed set of cases and
refreshing it is a decision, not a chore.

`ref` names the branch a pin's path lives on, where that is not the
repository's own default branch.
`.github/scripts/check_vendored_vectors.py` reads it as the `sha`
parameter of GitHub's "commits touching a path" API, which otherwise
walks the default branch alone and finds no commit touching a path that
only exists elsewhere, reported as a path the default branch never held
regardless of whether the pin is current. Absent, the call walks the
default branch.

A vector this package fails is vendored anyway and marked `xfail`, never
left out: an absent vector hides the defect it would have shown, and
`xfail_strict` turns the marker red the day the defect is fixed.

## Re-checking a pin

The commit stands in a fence of its own, sitting inside the API path
rather than at the end of the command; the fence below reads it as
`${commit:?}`, the shell's must-be-set form, so a paste of that fence
alone fails naming the variable.

```shell
commit=<the pin the entry gives>
```

```shell
git hash-object tests/schemes/_data/key_agg_vectors.json
gh api "repos/bitcoin/bips/git/trees/${commit:?}:bip-0327/vectors" \
    --jq '.tree[] | select(.path == "key_agg_vectors.json") | .sha'
```

The comparison is on git blob SHA-1, not sha256: it is what a tree entry
already carries, so nothing has to be downloaded, and `git hash-object`
reproduces it locally. Not the contents API, which is the obvious
alternative and caps out on a large file.

The weekly job runs this comparison for every entry whose heading is one
file's path and which carries a `blob` or an `ours` line, and fails,
naming the file, on a mismatch. It compares the file with `ours` (or
`blob`) and the entry's `blob` with upstream's at `commit`, so a file
edited here and a pin whose blob is not the one at its commit both fail.
Add an `ours` line to a new entry whose file is not upstream's bytes,
and a `-text` line for the file to `.gitattributes`.

The two hashes match for every file whose verdict is **identical**. Where
upstream is CRLF they cannot, this repository being LF throughout, and the
entry says so with our own blob alongside. Every csv file vendored from
bitcoin/bips is that case, and so far only those: `bip340_test_vectors.csv`,
the BIP324 files, the BIP374 files and the BIP459 files. A csv there is
written on Windows line endings often enough that it is worth expecting
rather than discovering -- `mixed-line-ending` rewrites the file with
`--fix=lf` as it is staged, so the blob to compare is never the one just
fetched.

## bitcoin/bips

### `tests/schemes/_data/bip340_test_vectors.csv`

```text
repo    bitcoin/bips
path    bip-0340/test-vectors.csv
commit  200f9b26fe0a2f235a2af8b30c4be9f12f6bc9cb  2023-04-20
blob    672339129a844a060591bb22f444158ff45438ed
ours    aa317a3b3d53aa904def8b5a625b13073898b349

behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical but for line endings** — upstream is CRLF and this
repository is LF throughout, which `mixed-line-ending` enforces with
`--fix=lf`, so our blob is `aa317a3b` rather than the one above. All 19
vectors, all eight columns.

Four of the 19 are messages of 0, 1, 17 and 100 bytes: BIP340 accepts a
message of any size, and so do the bindings — `sign_custom` and `verify`
take one, and no 32-byte gate sends these four down the Python path.
All four pass on either arithmetic: `verify_` accepts each, and `sign_`
reproduces each signature byte for byte.

### BIP327 (MuSig2): files under `tests/schemes/_data/`

The vectors of `bip-0327/vectors/`, vendored whole
and under upstream's own names: `key_sort_vectors.json`,
`key_agg_vectors.json`, `nonce_gen_vectors.json`,
`nonce_agg_vectors.json`, `sign_verify_vectors.json`,
`tweak_vectors.json`, `det_sign_vectors.json` and
`sig_agg_vectors.json`. Each is pinned below in its own entry, one real
path per pin, rather than to one placeholder path shared by all of them:
a placeholder is not a path GitHub's own "commits touching a path" API
can be asked about, which is what kept every one of them out of
the weekly check. It also papered over a real difference between
them: six were untouched since the commit that added all eight,
`87394eaeb436d02e0a68b38a1e94bc526d50056e` (2023-03-27, "Add BIP327:
MuSig2 for BIP340-compatible Multi-Signatures"); `sign_verify_vectors.json`
was fixed once since, at `508e3a6a40a6e73c73cbfa8a33aa18a2bc7b9d91`
(2024-05-14, "Fix the four test vectors"); and `sig_agg_vectors.json`
once more again, at `1c6ac0c4cf1f39ea806b8594d6060b6d52fd1439`
(2024-07-19, "bip327: minor fixes") -- the one commit the shared
placeholder cited as the tip of all eight paths, when it is the tip of
only that one.

56 cases between them, and `tests/schemes/musig2_test.py` runs every one:
1 sorting, 4 + 5 aggregations valid and failing, 4 nonce derivations,
2 + 3 nonce aggregations, 6 + 6 + 3 + 2 signatures (valid, refused at
signing, false on verification, refused on verification), 5 + 1
tweaked, 4 + 5 deterministic, 4 + 1 aggregated. An error case carries
what should be raised — which party contributed what, or the text of a
plain value error — and is checked against it, so the failing half of
each file is as load-bearing as the valid half.

What the files are measured against is `bip-0327/reference.py`, pinned
separately at `9297c12729670d09f9149ec6d8bad967d8161bfe` (2025-10-03,
the tip of that path): `src/ecc/ecc/musig2.py` follows it
function for function, and copies four of its error message strings
verbatim because the `error.message` field of a case is compared byte
for byte. That file is not vendored — it is an implementation, not data,
and this package's is the one under test.

### BIP324 (ElligatorSwift): files under `tests/schemes/_data/`

`ellswift_decode_test_vectors.csv` and `xswiftec_inv_test_vectors.csv`,
under upstream's own names, both genuinely tipped by the same commit --
unlike BIP327 above, there is no exception a shared pin would have
papered over here. Each is pinned below in its own entry, one real path
per pin, rather than to one placeholder path standing in for both: a
placeholder is not a path GitHub's own "commits touching a path" API can
be asked about, which is what kept the pair out of the weekly check.

### `tests/schemes/_data/ellswift_decode_test_vectors.csv`

```

Verdict: **identical but for line endings** — upstream is CRLF and this
repository is LF throughout, which `mixed-line-ending` enforces with
`--fix=lf`, so our blob is `bcc5b319` rather than the one above, the
same exception `bip340_test_vectors.csv` above documents.

behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical but for line endings**, the same exception, our
blob `135958f6` rather than the one above.

The files test the two halves of the map, and both halves are
this package's own Python: `tests/schemes/ellswift_test.py` runs the decode file
against `_xswiftec` and the inverse file against `_xswiftec_inv`, whose
eight `case` columns are eight assertions per row rather than one — an
empty cell is a case with no preimage, and asserting that it *has* none
is what keeps a permissive inverse from passing. The comment column of
each row names the branch it exercises (`valid_x(x1)`, `non_square(s)`,
`t>=p`, `info[v=0]`), which is what makes the files a branch
inventory and not a sample.

Neither file covers `create` or `encode`: those pick one of up to eight
preimages at random, so there is no vector to hold them to, and what the
suite asserts instead is the round trip against the bindings — the
authority named in the entry that has no file to cite.

`bip-0324/packet_encoding_test_vectors.csv` is the third file of that
directory and is **not** vendored: it is the v2 transport's, which this
package does not implement.

### BIP374 (DLEQ): files under `tests/schemes/_data/`

`test_vectors_generate_proof.csv` and `test_vectors_verify_proof.csv`,
under upstream's own names, which is the whole of `bip-0374/`'s vector
set. They are pinned separately below and their pins differ, which is
the reason a shared one is not offered: the verification file was
regenerated seven weeks after the generation file, and one pin would have
had to be wrong about one of them.

The names are unusually bare for a vendored file -- nothing in either
says BIP374 -- and they keep them anyway, the naming rule above being
that upstream's name is the one thing a citation cannot drift away from.

Verdict: **identical but for line endings** — upstream is CRLF and this

`--fix=lf`, so our blob is `78d78704` rather than the one above, the same
exception `bip340_test_vectors.csv` above documents.

All 11 vectors, all eight columns: five over a generator that is not
secp256k1's, three over secp256k1's own, and three failure cases -- a zero
scalar, a scalar equal to n, and a B at infinity, which the file spells
`INVALID` in the proof column and `INFINITY` in the point column.

behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **identical but for line endings**, the same exception, our blob
`2d4acdf1` rather than the one above.

All 17 vectors: the eight successes are the eight proofs of the file
above, read back, and the nine failures are five permutations of A, B and
C, a bit flipped in the proof, a bit flipped in the message, an `e` equal
to the curve order and an `s` equal to the curve order -- so the pair
covers both directions over one set of keys, and a permutation the
challenge would have accepted is a defect the generation file alone could
not show.

BIP374's failure conditions R1 and R2 landing on infinity have no vector
in either file and are covered by `tests/schemes/dleq_test.py` instead.
Neither is a proof anybody generates -- an infinite R needs s == e over
A == G or B == C -- so upstream's generator produces none and the test
builds each.

`s >= n` is reached by the verification file only at `s == n`; the test
adds the largest value an s field holds.

```

Verdict: **identical**. BIP341's wallet vectors, under upstream's own
name. `tests/schemes/ssa_tweak_test.py` reads the internal key, the tweak, the
output key and the control blocks of every `scriptPubKey` vector, and the
internal and tweaked private keys of every `keyPathSpending` input. The
script trees, addresses and signature hashes are read by nothing here.

### BIP459 (DahLIAS): files under `tests/schemes/_data/bip459/`

The csv files of `bip-0459/vectors/`, vendored whole and under upstream's
own names, in a subdirectory: the names say nothing of BIP459, and
`test_vectors_verify.csv` is a name another BIP's vectors could carry.

The BIP is a draft, on `bitcoin/bips#2210` and on no branch of
`bitcoin/bips` yet. Each pin is the pull request's head ref, which `ref`
names: GitHub keeps that ref in `bitcoin/bips` itself, so it survives the
fork's branch being renamed, rebased or deleted. `commit` is the last
commit on it touching the path, and the pull request's head when this
was pulled, `8678edb4ad56abd98acb56705b1a2861dcc97d8a`, holds the same
blob. The weekly check reports a new revision of the pull request that
touches a file. Once the BIP is merged the ref stops moving, and the
pins move to `master`.

`tests/schemes/dahlias_test.py` runs every case of every file. A
signature of the wrong size, which the verify file reads as False,
raises there instead, as the test module's docstring says.

## siv2r/bip-frost-signing

### BIP445 (FROST signing): files under `tests/schemes/_data/bip445/`

The JSON files of `python/vectors/`, vendored whole and under upstream's
own names, in a subdirectory rather than flat under `tests/schemes/_data/`:
BIP327 above already publishes files of these same names there, and a
vendored file keeps the name upstream gave it rather than losing it to
that collision.

The BIP is a draft, at version 0.12.1 in `siv2r/bip-frost-signing`. Its
pull request to `bitcoin/bips`, `bitcoin/bips#2070`, also reads 0.12.1 at
its head `363f69340b6731368db4a514147c7dec8eb5fd99`, but lacks
`siv2r/bip-frost-signing`'s commits from
`75318bc740428c435ec137842442879980fff1d5` (2026-10-12) to
`123f274a9197ca6c98e52b04a88b8c95f4c51dfe` (2026-10-13): the rule that an
input of the wrong length fails, the tweak vector file without its
wrong-length tweak, and the vectors at the largest number of participants
the BIP allows and for a zero tweak. The pins below follow
`siv2r/bip-frost-signing` for that reason, and move back to
`bitcoin/bips#2070` once it carries those commits. Each file is pinned to
the commit on that repository's default branch, `master`, that last
touched it, the same distinction the BIP327 entry above draws for
`sign_verify_vectors.json` and `sig_agg_vectors.json`.

`tests/schemes/frost_test.py` runs every case of every file. An error case
carries what should be raised -- which party contributed what, or the
text of a plain value error -- and is checked against it, the same
discipline the BIP327 entry above states.

`src/ecc/ecc/frost.py` follows `python/frost_ref/signing.py`
function for function, checked against it rather than assumed from the
BIP327 ancestry the reference's own header claims: several shapes that
read alike are not the same function, the tweak-range error message
among them. That file is not vendored -- it is an implementation, not
data, and this package's is the one under test.

pulled  2026-09-10, refreshed 2026-09-14 and 2026-10-07
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **transcribed**, mechanically: every `secp256k1_*` name the
pinned tree's own `src` spells, sorted and deduplicated. The pin stands
for a directory rather than for one upstream file, which is why the
block above carries no `blob` line and why what the weekly workflow
reports on it is a commit touching `src` — what a name added there or
taken away from it looks like from outside.

```shell
commit=<the pin this entry gives>
```

```shell
git grep -ohP '(?<![A-Za-z0-9_])secp256k1_[a-z0-9_]+' "${commit:?}" -- src \
    | sort -u
```

The names and not the headers holding them, because what reads the file
asks whether upstream has a name and never what its signature is:
`tests/upstream_symbols_test.py` refuses a docstring crediting
libsecp256k1 with a name that library does not have, `secp256k1_ecdsa_sign`
passing and secp256k1-zkp's `secp256k1_ecdsa_s2c_opening` failing. A copy
of the headers would answer that for the published part of the family and
leave C prototypes to be re-pinned for the rest of it.

`src` and not `include` for the same reason. `include` is what the library
publishes, where this tree names what it reads: `curves.curve`'s
`secp256k1_ge_x_on_curve_var` and `number_theory`'s `secp256k1_ctz64_var`
are that library's own and are declared in no header of `include`, only
in one under `src`. Nothing is lost at the other end — every name
`include` declares is spelled in `src` too, the difference being names a
header comment wraps in prose rather than declares.

The revision is one of bitcoin-core/secp256k1's own, and not the one the
bindings vendor. `btclib-secp256k1` compiles the library a caller loads
from a submodule of that repository, so what the suite links is the
submodule of the release `uv.lock` resolves:

```shell
version=<the btclib-secp256k1 version `uv.lock` resolves>
```

```shell
gh api \
    "repos/btclib-org/btclib-secp256k1/contents/secp256k1?ref=v${version:?}" \
    --jq .sha
```

A name upstream has added since that revision is in this set and not in
the library the suite runs against, and a name upstream has renamed away
is in that library and not in this set. The names are what the entry's own
re-derivation prints when it is run again at the submodule's revision
and compared with the vendored set. `comm` compares byte for byte on
input it takes as already sorted, so the vendored side is sorted again
under the collation the left side is being built in rather than trusted
to be in it: with the file's own order, a `sort` of another collation
answers a longer difference, and the `comm` macOS ships prints nothing
to say so.

```shell
submodule=<the sha the call above prints>
symbols=<the path to `tests/_data/secp256k1_symbols.txt`>
```

```shell
git grep -ohP '(?<![A-Za-z0-9_])secp256k1_[a-z0-9_]+' "${submodule:?}" \
    -- src | sort -u | comm -3 - <(sort "${symbols:?}")
```

Upstream is what the set is of, because that is the read a credit asks
for: `tests/upstream_symbols_test.py` refuses a credit a reader cannot
follow, and following one is a read of bitcoin-core/secp256k1's source.
Pinning to the submodule would answer for the library the bindings ship
and give that up — a renamed-away name would stay in the set, so a
credit spelling it would pass and land its reader on a function upstream
does not have. What neither pin answers is whether the installed
bindings expose a name, that being a fact about their own surface.

### `tests/schemes/_data/secp256k1_recovery_vectors.json`

```text
repo    bitcoin-core/secp256k1

pulled  2026-10-11
behind  0 revisions; that commit is the tip of the path
```

Verdict: **transcribed**, off `test_ecdsa_recovery_edge_cases`: the message
`msg32`, the signatures `sig64`, `sigb64` and `sigc64`, and for each the
recovery ids upstream asserts recover a key. In `sigb64` and `sigc64` r
equals s, and both are small. `recovers` maps a recovery id to that
assertion, and an id upstream does not ask about is absent. The rows with
a zero r or s are `sigc64` with the byte upstream's test zeroes. Every other
value is in the pinned blob when its `0x` arrays are read as octets, and
`msg32`, which upstream spells as character literals, is the ASCII of
`This is a very secret message...`:

```shell
blob=<the blob this entry gives>
value=<a hex string the file transcribes, r followed by s>
```

```shell
gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
    "repos/bitcoin-core/secp256k1/git/blobs/${blob:?}" \
    | python3 -c "import re,sys
h = ''.join(re.findall(r'0x([0-9a-fA-F]{2})', sys.stdin.read()))
print(sys.argv[1].lower() in h.lower())" "${value:?}"
```

The outcomes are libsecp256k1's own assertions, so a Python arm held to
them agrees with that library's accept and refuse pattern and not with a
derivation of its own, and for that reason the module reading the file,
`tests/schemes/dsa_secp256k1_recovery_test.py`, is not an authority in
`tests/py_arm_authority_test.py`. Upstream's comment says `sig64` was made
with secret key zero, which is not a valid key. This package refuses a
zero r or s where upstream parses it; the test asks `recover_pub_key_`
for the refusal.

```

Verdict: **transcribed**, off `key_test1`: the keys it decodes from
WIF (`strSecret1`, `strSecret1C`, `strSecret2`, `strSecret2C`), the message
`Very deterministic message`, and the compact signature `SignCompact`
must give for each, which the test checks as hex. A compact signature is
a flag byte, which carries the recovery id and whether the key is
compressed, then r and s. The message is hashed with Core's `Hash`, which
is double SHA256, and the test applies that. Core's test also recovers the
key from a compact signature and compares it with the key of the WIF, as
`tests/schemes/dsa_recovery_test.py` does. The expected compact signatures
are libsecp256k1's output inside Core: `CKey::SignCompact` calls
`secp256k1_ecdsa_sign_recoverable` at the pinned commit. What is
independent of it is that the recovered key equals the key of the WIF.
`tests/schemes/dsa_sign_recoverable_test.py` checks signing against the
signatures and is not counted as an authority.
Every string in the file is in the pinned blob:

```shell
blob=<the blob this entry gives>

### C2SP/wycheproof: the ECDSA and ECDH files under `tests/schemes/_data/`

The adversarial vectors, and the one upstream here published under a
licence that is not MIT: Apache-2.0, whose condition on redistribution
is a copy of the licence, so `WYCHEPROOF_COPYING` is vendored beside
them and has its own entry below. There is no `NOTICE` file at the pin
to carry with it.

Each entry below is pinned to its own path's last commit rather than to
one commit shared by all of them, since the files do not all move
together. All live in `testvectors_v1/`. Not `testvectors/`, which
upstream removed on 2025-09-02 and which no refresh can reach again.
They are read by `tests/schemes/wycheproof_test.py`, which is also where
the split between the two ECDSA profiles is explained, and where the
difference the files under a hash other than sha256 make is:
`_libsecp256k1_serves` admits sha256 alone, so those reach the Python
arithmetic without the dispatch being switched off, and are run once
rather than twice.

The SHAKE files need one thing the others do not, and it is a type
rather than a reader: `hashlib.shake_128` is not a `HashF`, an
extendable-output function having no output length of its own, so
`_PinnedXof` in that module pins one and `src/ecc/alias.py`
says why the package does not. The pinned length is `n_size` and any
length above it is the same test, `challenge_` reading the leftmost
`nlen` bits of a digest whose longer forms have these very bytes as
their prefix -- measured, all files verify identically at 32 and at 64.

`ecdsa_secp256k1_sha256_bitcoin_test.json` names its own schema now,
`ecdsa_bitcoin_verify_schema.json`, which upstream added beside it;
upstream's own README still lists the file as missing one, unrenewed in
the same commit. No longer frozen at `generatorVersion 0.9rc5` either:
that top-level field is gone, replaced by a `source: {name, version}`
object per test group, `version` carrying the same string. Vendored
regardless of the schema's presence or absence, which is what
bitcoin-core/secp256k1 and secp256k1lab both do with it.

Verdict: **identical**. The bitcoin profile, `EcdsaBitcoinVerify`: the
strict DER encoding, and the low-s rule, under which the malleable high-s
twin of a valid signature is `invalid`. This package's parser is the strict one
and its verifier does not apply that rule, so two of these verdicts
are exempted rather than asserted — `wycheproof_test.py` reads which two
out of the file below.

The pin adds tcId 464 to the file at its previous pin (`234d9689d0cb`),
in a test group of its own: an `invalid` signature whose r + n equals
x(kG) modulo p but is not below p. Every other test group and case is
unchanged; `numberOfTests` counts the new one.

Verdict: **identical**. The same algorithm, curve and hash as the file
above, without the bitcoin profile's two extra rules: what a
general-purpose ECDSA verifier must accept. It is therefore also the
oracle for the exemption named above — a key and a signature `valid` here
and `invalid` there differ by the low-s rule and by nothing else.

Verdict: **identical**. The same stream read at the same `n_size`, over
a sponge of a different rate. Its tcId 425 is upstream's
`Untruncatedhash` case, a signature made over the whole digest instead
of its leftmost `nlen` bits and therefore `invalid` -- which is also the
evidence that upstream generated this file at a length wider than the
order, and that reading the stream at `n_size` reads the leftmost bits
it read.

above with the keys JWK-encoded (RFC 7517) rather than X.509: `WrongCurve`
here attacks the JWK `crv` field where that file's attacks the DER OID,

Verdict: **identical but for a trailing newline** -- upstream ends
without one and the `end-of-file-fixer` hook added it, so our blob is
`d6456956`, which is the Apache-2.0 text as most repositories carry it.
The stock text, with no copyright line filled in and no `NOTICE` beside
it, so this file is the whole of what the licence asks a redistributor
to carry.

Renamed, against the naming rule above, and the reason is what the rule
is for. Upstream calls it `LICENSE`, and a file of that name inside
`tests/schemes/_data/` would read as licensing the directory it sits in --
which is false, the BIP and rustyrussell files beside it having their
own terms and this repository's own `LICENSE` being at the root. The upstream
name is in the entry above instead, where the pin already is. It is the
name bitcoin-core/secp256k1 gives its copy for the same reason.

Verdict: **transcribed**, mechanically. One json object per `vector_<n>`
array of `test_rangeproof_fixed_vectors` and
`test_rangeproof_fixed_vectors_reproducible`, which is where
libsecp256k1-zkp publishes fixed rangeproofs: `proof` and `commitment`
are that array and the `commit_<n>` beside it, `blind` is the `blind_<n>`
of the first function and the `vector_blind` the second shares, `nonce`
is the `nonce_3` the first rewinds its `vector_3` under and the
`vector_nonce` the second shares, and
`value` and `verify` are what those functions' own `CHECK`s state about
the octets -- the value a rewind answers, and the range
`secp256k1_rangeproof_verify` answers. `id` is the function and the array
upstream names each by. The pass that produced the file is not committed
-- a one-off read of C source is not a tool -- and what re-derives it is
reading those arrays again.

Not vendored as the file itself because there is no data file upstream
and none anywhere: this format has no published vector file, which is
what the entry below says of it too, so the blob above is that C source
and the weekly re-check reports a proof added to it. The bindings
`uv.lock` resolves vendor a fork of that repository: their
`secp256k1-zkp` submodule is `a8f6b86a804cdfd455dfb943937d254ec6ccc70a`
of `fametrano/secp256k1-zkp`, which exposes
`secp256k1_borromean_verify` as public API, so the blob at this path
there is `02276b1b8745b90c7b6a50a0e3a89b9438e30397` and not the one
above. Both functions this entry transcribes read the same in the fork's
blob, byte for byte, as do the `vector_blind` and `vector_nonce`
declared between them, so the transcription's source is the code the
bindings run.

`vector_1` and `vector_2` of `test_rangeproof_fixed_vectors` carry no
`nonce` field because upstream declares no array for them: it rewinds
those under `pc.data`, and `secp256k1_pedersen_commitment_parse` ends by
copying its input into `commit->data` verbatim, so what a rewind reads
there is the leading octets of the `commitment` above, one scalar wide.
The message a rewind also answers is left out,
`tests/schemes/rangeproof_fixed_vectors_test.py` holding what upstream
signed each entry with instead.

That module asks for the octets back out, the range the header proves,
the rings the value's digits index, `ecc.ecc.rangeproof.verify` against the
commitment published beside each proof, and a rewind of every entry.
The entries of
`tests/schemes/_data/zkp_rangeproof_vectors.json` record a nonce of their
own, and `tests/schemes/rangeproof_test.py` is where those are rewound.

```

Verdict: **transcribed**, mechanically. One json object per element of
each `secp256k1_ge_storage results[]` array upstream declares in that
file, `x` and `y` being the halves of a `SECP256K1_GE_STORAGE_CONST`.
`shallue van de woestijne` is `test_shallue_van_de_woestijne`'s array
and `t` the field element that function maps -- its loop counter, then
that counter negated, which is the order the array is indexed in;
`generator generate` is `test_generator_generate`'s and `seed` the `v`
that function fills with its own counter. `id` names the argument rather
than the position. The pass that produced the file is not committed -- a
one-off read of C source is not a tool -- and what re-derives it is
reading those arrays again.

Not vendored as the file itself for the reason the entry above gives:
this map has no published vector file anywhere, upstream stating its own
against the sage program it keeps beside the code. The bindings
`uv.lock` resolves vendor a fork of that repository,
`fametrano/secp256k1-zkp` at
`a8f6b86a804cdfd455dfb943937d254ec6ccc70a`; the blob at this path there
is `14ec95dc94780126a796866b05eeafa2093bf22f` and not the one above. Of the
functions this entry transcribes, `test_generator_generate` reads the same
in both, and `test_shallue_van_de_woestijne` differs only where its loop
calls `secp256k1_fe_set_int` in the fork and `secp256k1_fe_set_int_unchecked`
above. The arrays read the same in both, so the transcription's source is
the code the bindings run.

`tests/schemes/pedersen_test.py` is what reads it: the first array against
`ecc.ecc.pedersen._shallue_van_de_woestijne` and the second against
`generator_from_seed`, at no blinding factor and at a zero one, which is
the pair of calls upstream's own loop makes of each entry.

```

Verdict: **transcribed**, mechanically. One json object per block of
`test_schnorr_adaptor_spec_vectors`, the vectors of the `schnorr_adaptor`
module BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp#299 proposes. `id` is the
block's comment, each hex field is the `0x` array of that name, and
`checks` names the helpers the block calls, with the flags it passes
them. A block that only asks whether a key or an adaptor point parses
carries the parse function's name, set to false. The pass that produced
the file is not committed, and what re-derives it is reading those arrays
again; the command in the entry of `tests/schemes/dsa_anti_exfil_test.py`
finds each value in the pinned blob.

The pin is the branch of the fork the pull request is opened from, which
`ref` names. `commit` is the last commit on it touching the path, and the
pull request's head, c2f270985d, holds the same blob. The module is on
no branch of secp256k1-zkp itself, so the file is a reference and not an
authority: a revision of the pull request is what the weekly check
reports. `tests/schemes/ssa_adaptor_test.py` runs every block.

```

Verdict: **transcribed**, off `ecdsa_s2c_tests`, the array
`test_ecdsa_s2c_fixed_vectors` and `test_ecdsa_anti_exfil_signer_commit`
both walk: `_ZKP_VECTORS` is its rows, column for column -- `s2c_data`,
`expected_s2c_opening` and `expected_s2c_exfil_opening` -- and
`_PRV_KEY` and `_MSG_HASH` are the key and the message both functions
run those rows against. There is no blob to compare, the values
being `0x` arrays inside C source, so what is checked is that each of
them is in the pinned blob when those arrays are read as octets rather
than as text:

```shell
blob=<the blob this entry gives>
value=<a hex string the module transcribes>
```

```shell
gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
    "repos/BlockstreamResearch/secp256k1-zkp/git/blobs/${blob:?}" \
    | python3 -c "import re,sys
h = ''.join(re.findall(r'0x([0-9a-fA-F]{2})', sys.stdin.read()))
print(sys.argv[1].lower() in h.lower())" "${value:?}"
```

Source rather than a data file, and pinned here for what the columns
settle: a row's openings are one `anti_exfil_host_commit` apart, so the
module holds the R the device promises and the R its signature carries
to libsecp256k1-zkp's own octets rather than to this package run twice. A row
upstream regenerates is one this tree would go on asserting, which is
what the pin is read for. The module points here for the revision
and carries none of its own, which is what puts the pin where the weekly
workflow reads it.

this format too. What libsecp256k1-zkp publishes instead is inside a C
test source, `src/modules/rangeproof/tests_impl.h` -- blob
`19c83ecbd84ae318d8eccf9336638238d3a29826` at the submodule commit
above -- where `test_rangeproof_fixed_vectors` and
`test_rangeproof_fixed_vectors_reproducible` hold proofs as C arrays,
beside the commitments and the ranges they assert. Those are the entry
`zkp_rangeproof_fixed_vectors.json` has above, and are not what this
file holds: each entry below is one proof
libsecp256k1-zkp signed for this tree, kept verbatim, beside the
arguments that produced it and what that library then said about it.

It is here because `tests/schemes/rangeproof_test.py` would otherwise
measure nothing in an unflagged build: the flagged extension those
calls need is what a btclib-secp256k1 installed from its sdist with
`BTCLIB_LIBSECP256K1_ZKP` has, and `ecc.ecc.rangeproof` reads a
format no other vector file in this tree carries.

**Recording another is this file's own arguments.** A rangeproof draws
nothing -- its nonces are the hash chain `rangeproof_genrand` derives
from the caller's -- so `sign` called again with an entry's `blind`,
`nonce`, `value` and `sign arguments` answers that entry's `proof`,
byte for byte. `test_the_vectors_are_what_zkp_signs_today` is that
check, so the procedure is a test rather than a note here, and it runs
wherever the extension does. The same determinism makes the entries an
oracle for what this package writes: `ecc.ecc.rangeproof.sign` builds a proof
from an entry's own `blind`, `value`, `nonce` and `sign arguments`, and
`test_sign_writes_the_octets_zkp_signed` holds it to these octets
wherever the suite runs, extension or not.
`test_sign_public_value_writes_the_octets_zkp_signed` asks the same of
the spelling that fixes the exponent for a value stated in the clear,
and both shapes that proof has are recorded, `public value` carrying a
`min_value` field and `public value, zero` carrying none, so neither is
left to the weekly sentinel.

**The `info` key is why a run without the extension still compares
against something.** Those are `zkp.rangeproof.info`'s own answers for
the same octets, so this package's reading of a header is held
to libsecp256k1-zkp's rather than to its own; what `info` says
nothing about -- the sign bits, the ring commitments and the borromean
signature -- is held by the proof going back out byte for byte.

### `tests/schemes/_data/der_length_vectors.json`

```text
program   cryptography (pyca/cryptography)
calls     encode_dss_signature(r, s)
recorded  2026-09-14
```

Verdict: **recorded**. There is no upstream vector file and no
repository: an outside DER encoder's own bytes, recorded once for a
fixed `(r, s)` on each of `bpp512r1`, `nistp521` and `secp521r1` -- the
catalogued curves whose signature reaches DER's long length form -- and
for a scalar pair on `secp256k1` wide enough that no catalogued curve's
own element does
([ISS 2130](https://github.com/btclib-org/btclib/issues/2130)).

It is here because nothing else in this tree can hold `Sig.serialize`'s
length octets to a parser it did not write: `libsecp256k1_dsa` answers
for `secp256k1` alone, and a decoder or a copy of the encoder written
beside the fix would share its author and the same reading of the
standard, proving nothing about whether that reading is the standard's
own. `tests/schemes/der_test.py`'s `test_der_matches_a_vendored_der_oracle`
compares `serialize()` to each entry's `der` field, byte for byte.

**Recording another** is `dsa.sign`'s own deterministic nonce for each
curve entry, and a synthetic scalar pair for the wide-element one:

```shell
uv run --locked --with cryptography python - <<'EOF'
from ecc.curves.curve import CURVES
from ecc.ecc import dsa
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.utils import (
    encode_dss_signature)

for name in ("bpp512r1", "nistp521", "secp521r1"):
    sig = dsa.sign(b"msg", 0x1234567890ABCDEF, ec=CURVES[name])
    print(name, hex(sig.r), hex(sig.s),
          encode_dss_signature(sig.r, sig.s).hex())

r = s = (1 << 1023) + 1
print("secp256k1", hex(r), hex(s), encode_dss_signature(r, s).hex())
EOF
```

Nothing upstream will ever refresh this file: `cryptography`'s encoder
is the fixed point being checked against, not a moving target.

## Outside vectors for the arms and curves other than secp256k1

For each case, which vector of somebody else's making holds it, or that
none was found. Read on 2026-10-11, and each claim has the command that
re-checks it. The Wycheproof commit is
`12fd3aaf33eb5fa1f52e026912ee00c054f9d984`. The commands below read the
file names of its `testvectors_v1/`, not the files. The other sources are
bitcoin/bips at `927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4` and python-ecdsa
(tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa) at `bff40c6cf2340148d410d5b3def0e949c547caf1`.

- **ECDSA signing and verifying on P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521**:
  the appendix of the RFC that `rfc6979.json` transcribes, vendored.
- **ECDSA verifying on the other curves**: Wycheproof has `ecdsa_*` files
  for the curves this prints, vendored only for secp256k1:

  ```shell
  commit=<the Wycheproof commit above>
  ```

  ```shell
  gh api "repos/C2SP/wycheproof/git/trees/${commit:?}:testvectors_v1" \
      --jq '.tree[].path' \
      | sed -nE 's/^ecdsa_(.*)_sha[0-9a-z]+_(p1363_)?test\.json$/\1/p' \
      | sort -u
  ```

  They are secp160k1, secp160r1, secp160r2, secp192k1, secp192r1,
  secp224k1, secp224r1, secp256k1, secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1 and
  brainpoolP224r1 to brainpoolP512r1. Here those brainpool curves are
  `bpp224r1` to `bpp512r1`, and secp192r1 to secp521r1 are also `nistp192`
  to `nistp521`. A curve of `CURVES` it does not print under either name
  has no Wycheproof file: secp112r1, secp112r2, secp128r1, secp128r2,
  `bpp160r1` and `bpp192r1`.
- **ECDSA signing on secp160k1, secp160r1, secp160r2, secp192k1,
  secp224k1 and `bpp224r1` to `bpp512r1`**: none found in the RFC
  or Wycheproof. The RFC's test vectors are for DSA, the NIST prime curves and
  the binary curves, as the headings this prints show:

  ```shell
  curl -s https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979.txt \
      | grep -E "^A\.2\.[0-9]+\."
  ```

  Every Wycheproof `ecdsa_*` file names a verification schema, none a
  signing one, as this prints (it reads each file of the commit above):

  ```shell
  repo=repos/C2SP/wycheproof
  for f in $(gh api "${repo}/git/trees/${commit:?}:testvectors_v1" \
      --jq '.tree[].path' | grep '^ecdsa_'); do
    gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
        "${repo}/contents/testvectors_v1/${f}?ref=${commit:?}" \
        | grep -m1 '"schema"'
  done | sort | uniq -c
  ```

  The curves without a Wycheproof file are taken by the next bullet.
- **ECDSA on secp112r1, secp112r2, secp128r1, secp128r2, `bpp160r1` and
  `bpp192r1`**: no outside vector was found in Wycheproof, python-ecdsa or
  the RFC. Wycheproof has no file for them, by the call above. The RFC has
  no appendix for them: the first count this prints is zero, and the
  second, a control for the fetch, is above zero:

  ```shell
  curl -s https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979.txt \
      | grep -ciE "secp112|secp128|brainpool"
  curl -s https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6979.txt | grep -ci "nist"
  ```

  python-ecdsa defines all of them but secp128r2, by the `curves.py` call
  in the last bullet. Its test files name them in the lines this prints,
  which were read: key generation and signing round trips, interoperability
  with OpenSSL where OpenSSL has the curve, arithmetic on the generator
  (Jacobi coordinates, precomputation), a stored public point in an
  inequality test, and the point of the last bullet. None stores a
  signature to verify, so none is an outside vector for ECDSA:

  ```shell
  dir=<a scratch directory>
  ```

  ```shell
  git clone --quiet --filter=blob:none --no-checkout \
      https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa "${dir:?}/python-ecdsa"
  ```

  ```shell
  git -C "${dir:?}/python-ecdsa" grep -n -iE \
      "112r[12]|128r1|brainpoolP(160|192)r1" \
      bff40c6cf2340148d410d5b3def0e949c547caf1 -- 'src/ecdsa/test_*.py'
  ```

- **ECDH and point decoding**: Wycheproof has `ecdh_*` files for the
  names this prints, vendored only for secp256k1:

  ```shell
  gh api "repos/C2SP/wycheproof/git/trees/${commit:?}:testvectors_v1" \
      --jq '.tree[].path' \
      | sed -nE 's/^ecdh_(.*)_test\.json$/\1/p' | sort -u
  ```

  They are secp224r1, secp256r1, secp384r1, secp521r1 (some with `_pem`,
  `_webcrypto` or `_ecpoint` variants), the brainpool curves above,
  secp256k1 (with a `_webcrypto` variant), and binary curves that `CURVES`
  does not have. The `_ecpoint` files are named for a bare point, and what
  their cases reach was not read.
- **Schnorr and batch verification**: none found. BIP340 is for secp256k1,
  and this prints its sentence on other curves:

  ```shell
  ref=927b6de9915c9262615a6399de51b200f81e5aa4
  ```

  ```shell
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
      "repos/bitcoin/bips/contents/bip-0340.mediawiki?ref=${ref:?}" \
      | grep "not straightforward"
  ```

- **The subgroup check on a curve of cofactor above one**, which this
  prints (secp112r2 and secp128r2):

  ```shell
  uv run python -c "from ecc.curves.curve import CURVES; \
  print([n for n, c in CURVES.items() if c.cofactor > 1])"
  ```

  Wycheproof has no file for either, by the call above. python-ecdsa
  defines secp112r2 and not secp128r2, and defines BRAINPOOLP160r1 and
  BRAINPOOLP192r1, which are `bpp160r1` and `bpp192r1` here:

  ```shell
  ref=bff40c6cf2340148d410d5b3def0e949c547caf1
  ```

  ```shell
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
      "repos/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa/contents/src/ecdsa/curves.py?ref=${ref:?}" \
      | grep -ohE 'SECP1[12][0-9]r[12]|BRAINPOOLP(160|192)r1' | sort -u
  ```

  Its `src/ecdsa/test_ecdsa.py` (blob
  `c1e25829b8558876021f9cdf3401a95a4cd56075` at commit
  `c98364927e406af037d8f9652ff18094f207dcec`) has a point of secp112r2
  that is on the curve, and tests that expect `Public_key` and
  `point_is_valid` to refuse it as outside the subgroup of the generator.
  This prints them:

  ```shell
  blob=c1e25829b8558876021f9cdf3401a95a4cd56075
  ```

  ```shell
  gh api -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.raw' \
      "repos/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa/git/blobs/${blob:?}" \
      | grep -n -A12 "def test_.*not_scalar_multiple_of_base_point"
  ```

  The point is also checked with python-ecdsa's own code at the pinned
  commit; this prints `True False False`, that is on the curve, refused by
  `point_is_valid`, and the group order times it is not the point at
  infinity:

  ```shell
  uv run --no-project \
      --with "ecdsa @ git+https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa@${ref:?}" \
      python -I -c "
  from ecdsa.ecdsa import generator_112r2 as g, point_is_valid
  from ecdsa.ellipticcurve import PointJacobi, INFINITY
  x, y = 0x02, 0xBE6AA4938EF7CFE6FE29595B6B00
  P = PointJacobi(g.curve(), x, y, 1)
  print(g.curve().contains_point(x, y), point_is_valid(g, x, y),
        (P * g.order()) == INFINITY)"
  ```

  That one case is an outside vector for secp112r2. It is not vendored,
  and what this package answers for it was not measured. For secp128r2
  none was found.

## What is not pinned, and why

- **The transcribed files** are pinned to a prose revision, or, where the
  upstream is a source file rather than a document, to that file's blob;
  neither makes "identical" a claim that can be made about them. What was
  checked is stated in each entry: matching every value verbatim against
  the pinned text, or a check the entry states on its own.
- **The suite checks the local half, offline.**
  `tests/check_vendored_vectors_test.py` holds each file this ledger names
  to its `ours` line, or its `blob` where there is none. No test asks
  upstream for a blob: a network call in the suite would trade a
  documented drift for a flaky one.
  `.github/workflows/vendored-vectors.yml` asks upstream, weekly. A byte
  mismatch fails the run. A stale pin opens an issue rather than being
  refreshed -- which vector to take next is a decision. The staleness
  check skips an entry whose `behind` reads other than 0, a gap somebody
  has decided not to close being one it would report every week.

## Summary

No count here, and no count in front of the lists below. A count is a
line every open branch has to edit, so it is the one conflict a pull
request vendoring a file is guaranteed to have -- and two branches moving
it to the same new number merge with nothing to decide, into a number
that is wrong. The lists *are* the fact the number summarized, and the
tree answers whenever the number is wanted:

```shell
git ls-files 'tests/_data/*' 'tests/*/_data/*' | grep -cv 'README.md'
```

Against a pinned upstream blob:

- identical byte for byte: the BIP327 vector files,
  `wallet-test-vectors.json`, the Wycheproof vector files and
  `ecdsa_adaptor.json`.
- identical but for a trailing newline: `WYCHEPROOF_COPYING`,
  `dlc_schnorr_test.json` and the BIP445 vector files.
- identical but for CRLF against LF: `bip340_test_vectors.csv`, the
  BIP324 vector files, the BIP374 vector files and the BIP459 vector
  files -- every csv
  vendored from bitcoin/bips, so far.
- JSON-equal, reformatted: `pubkey.json`, `ecdsa_sig.json`,
  `ecdsa_custom_nonce_sig.json`.

Not checked byte for byte against one:

- transcribed, every value matched either in the pinned text or, for a
  source file, by the check the entry itself states: `rfc6979.json`,
  `zkp_rangeproof_fixed_vectors.json`, `zkp_generator_vectors.json`,
  `zkp_schnorr_adaptor_vectors.json`,
  `dsa_anti_exfil_test.py`, `secp256k1_symbols.txt`,
  `bitcoin_core_compact_vectors.json` and `secp256k1_recovery_vectors.json`.
- not vendored: `zkp_rangeproof_vectors.json` and
  `der_length_vectors.json` (this suite's own).
