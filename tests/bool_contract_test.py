"""The gate for the bool contract, over what only a fixture can reach.

CONTRIBUTING.md's "Every public function validates its inputs" states
rules about a function that answers a `bool`, and
`input_validation_test.py` drives them automatically -- over the
functions whose every required parameter is a library input type. That
leaves out the ones this file is about, and they are the ones the rules
were argued over: a signature verification takes a valid message, key and
signature, and a `Sig | Octets` that no vocabulary of wrong values can
build.

So the calls here are hand-written, which is issue btclib-org/btclib#776's own
answer to what its walk cannot reach: "a hand-written table of name, and the
shortest call that reaches the validator". Each case names a function, a call of
it that answers True, a wrong value for each position worth driving, and a
structurally invalid one for each position where the two diverge. Three rules,
asked one position at a time with the others left valid:

- a **wrong type** leaves as an `EccTypeError`. A bool is an answer
  about a value, so a type the signature does not declare is not
  something it answers about.
- a **wrong value** of a declared type is `False`. That is what the bool
  is for, and what a caller filtering signatures off the wire relies on.
- a value of a declared type whose size or encoding makes it **structurally
  invalid** -- one no valid input could ever carry, as opposed to one that is
  merely not authentic -- is an `EccValueError`. A verification is
  not the question that value answers, so it is refused rather than read as a
  forged signature. What decides is whether the position declares a size:
  `dsa.verify_`'s digest does and `dsa.verify`'s message does not, so the same
  wrong octets are a refusal in one case and `False` in the other.

Issue btclib-org/btclib#814 settled the second against issue
btclib-org/btclib#745's "total over everything it is handed", and this is
where the decision is held to. Issue btclib-org/btclib#2170 is where the
third was carved out of the second, for the `ecc.ecc` verifications: a
signature, a key or an opening whose size or encoding makes it impossible
is refused there.

There is no list of exceptions: a finding this file makes is a red test
above, to be fixed or to be given a reason of its own.

What no case here drives, and why: `musig2`'s and `frost`'s
`partial_sig_verify` and `partial_sig_verify_`, and `dahlias`'s
`partial_sig_verify`, want a session and a signing round, `dsa`'s and
`ssa`'s `anti_exfil_host_verify` a host-device exchange, and
`borromean.verify` and `rangeproof.verify` a ring signature or a proof
built for them. Those are driven by the tests
of their own modules, against fixtures those modules build.
